JS8 in Rust
===========

[JS8](http://js8call.com/) is a digital mode protocol for hamradio.

Objective of this library is to have a working library in Rust to encode & decode messages
so as to do more embedded projects using this mode. I especially aims to use it in conjunction with [FutureSDR](https://www.futuresdr.org/) to further test this idea.
